### 📋 Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries** — Loaded Pandas, NumPy, and configured the environment.
2. **Load Dataset** — Read the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Initial Exploration** — Displayed first 5 rows, `.info()`, `.describe()`, and column details.
4. **Missing Value Identification** — Used `isnull().sum()` to detect 309 missing values in `CouponCode`.
5. **Missing Value Handling** — Filled `CouponCode` nulls using **Mode** (most frequent value), appropriate for categorical data.
6. **Duplicate Detection** — Used `duplicated().sum()` — found 0 duplicates.
7. **Duplicate Removal** — Applied `drop_duplicates()` as a best-practice safeguard.
8. **Data Format Corrections:**
   - Converted `Date` column to `YYYY-MM-DD` string format.
   - Stripped leading/trailing whitespace from all text columns.
   - Standardized text capitalization to Title Case.
   - Verified numerical columns have correct `int64`/`float64` data types.
9. **Final Verification** — Confirmed:
   - ✅ Zero missing values
   - ✅ Zero duplicate rows
   - ✅ Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - ✅ Correct data types
10. **Export** — Saved the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_dataset.csv`.

### 🎯 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a professional, end-to-end data cleaning pipeline on a real-world e-commerce dataset. All 309 missing values were handled using statistically appropriate techniques (Mode for categorical data), data formats were standardized, and comprehensive validation confirmed the dataset is clean and analysis-ready.

The cleaned dataset (`cleaned_dataset.csv`) is ready for downstream analysis tasks including exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
